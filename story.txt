Once upon a time, there was a 19 year old college student named Daniel living in Madison, Wisconsin. He attended UW-Madison, like most other students in the area, and life was pretty normal, until one day a mysterious disease known as BROVID-19 emerged in the East and left the world in a state of panic after spreading like wildfire. It was unlike anything the world had seen in centuries - People couldn't risk leaving their houses, global economies were collapsing, and people were afraid they would never return to their old ways. All hope seemed lost until one day, Daniel went hiking in the woods and came across a magical plant, with flowers the size of his head. 
Curiosity got the better of Daniel, and he picked up the plant to bring back to his apartment. He walked through the door, only to find his roommates had contracted the virus. As Daniel went to show them the flower he found, one of the petals began to wilt. At that exact moment, his roommates discovered that they could smell and taste again. The three of them stared as the petal drifted down to the floor, and the color returned to their faces. The roommates appeared to be BROVID free, and Daniel started to wonder what exactly he had stumbled upon. 
He had found the magical cure for the worst disease seen in ages. Daniel and his friends decided they needed to get this to the public as soon as possible. They emailed theyre biology teacher with the information they had found in hopes that she would know where to go with it. Sure enough, they got a call from the president of the united states three hours after this email was sent. "Get ready Daniel" The president said. "Im coming in a helicopter to secure the cure." 30 minutes passed when Daniel heard the roaring of the helicoptor blades. It landed, and Donald Trump stepped out, hair flowing in the wind. He took the cure, thanked Daniel for his work, and distributed it to the whole world in 18 days!! BROVID was no longer a fear!!
